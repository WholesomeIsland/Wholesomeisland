### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**WholesomeIsland/Wholesomeisland** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on boopes, a C library for OOP in embedded systems along with SimpleCC, a compiler for a programming language i made.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything in C, C++, c#
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything related to boopes or simplec
- âš¡ Fun fact: you can use pointers in c# with the unsafe keyword on a method/other block of code

For programming I use vim, with nerdtree and coc.nvim for C++, and no desktop. I use a straight linux terminal.
